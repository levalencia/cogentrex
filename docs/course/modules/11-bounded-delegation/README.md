# Module 11 — Bounded delegation and hybrid orchestration

> **Documentation status:** Draft
> **Estimated time:** 90 minutes
> **Canonical concepts:** [bounded-delegation](../../concepts/bounded-delegation.md), [verifier-child](../../concepts/verifier-child.md), [parent-child-lineage](../../concepts/parent-child-lineage.md)

## Why this module exists

A second model can add cost and authority without adding trust. This module starts with Cogentrex's narrow evidence-only verifier and then extends the same signed, bounded lineage model into the feature-flagged hybrid orchestration pilot. You will produce a parent-child evidence graph and explain why neither design is an unbounded swarm nor generic self-reflection.

## Beginner explanation

Cogentrex has two distinct bounded delegation paths. The verifier sees a sealed claim/evidence packet and has no tools. The hybrid pilot can run a fixed researcher and a server-templated dynamic analyst with read-only capability subsets. Both paths use finite budgets, signed one-use scope, durable lineage, and fail-closed validation; model output can still be wrong.

## Prerequisites and vocabulary

### Learn first

- [Module 08: grounded RAG](../08-rag-grounding/README.md) — claims, evidence and deterministic grounding.
- [Module 09: evaluation](../09-evaluation-harness/README.md) — versioned measurement and honest quality claims.

### Vocabulary

| Term | Beginner definition | Canonical source |
|---|---|---|
| delegation | A parent assigns a finite task to a child. | [bounded-delegation](../../concepts/bounded-delegation.md) |
| verdict | A typed supported, rejected, or escalate result for one claim. | [verifier-child](../../concepts/verifier-child.md) |
| lineage | A durable `parent_run_id` edge between run records. | [parent-child-lineage](../../concepts/parent-child-lineage.md) |
| budget | An enforced maximum for input/output tokens, time, and retries. | [bounded-delegation](../../concepts/bounded-delegation.md) |

## Learning outcomes

After this module, the learner can:

1. construct and validate the child request boundary;
2. trace one child from grounded workflow through ledger events;
3. explain malformed-output, timeout, and escalation behavior;
4. measure benefit without claiming semantic truth or a swarm;
5. distinguish a purpose-built verifier from fixed and dynamic general-purpose child profiles;

## Problem and mental model

Use a sealed review packet. The parent supplies exact claims and evidence IDs; the child cannot fetch more evidence or use tools. The model output is untrusted until strict parsing proves every claim appears exactly once and every cited evidence ID was delegated. The invariant is bounded authority, not model infallibility.

## Two delegation patterns, one safety model

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Parent[Parent run] --> Choice{Delegation pattern}
  Choice --> Verifier[Evidence verifier]
  Choice --> Team[Hybrid Team pilot]

  Verifier --> VScope[Exact claims + evidence
no tools]
  Team --> Fixed[Fixed researcher
read-only tools]
  Team --> Dynamic[Dynamic analyst template
read-only tools]

  VScope --> Controls[Signed envelope
finite budget
depth one
durable lineage]
  Fixed --> Controls
  Dynamic --> Controls
```

| Dimension | Evidence verifier | Hybrid pilot |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | Grounded-answer verification | Auto router or explicit Team |
| Children | One purpose-built verifier | One fixed researcher plus one dynamic-template analyst |
| Tools | None | Explicit read-only subset |
| Output use | Conservative claim filtering | Untrusted supporting context for parent synthesis |
| UI | Grounding/evidence views | Execution-mode control and Agents inspector |
| Current evidence | Deterministic and live-provider verifier acceptance | Deterministic mock-provider and browser-contract acceptance only |

“Dynamic” describes request-specific task selection inside a server-owned template. It does not permit a model-authored system prompt, arbitrary capabilities, recursive delegation, terminal access, writes, memory mutation, or background jobs.

### Hybrid request sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant R as Auto/Single/Team router
  participant P as Parent runtime
  participant E as Envelope service
  participant C as Child runtimes
  participant L as Run Ledger

  U->>R: request + execution mode
  R->>L: orchestration_routed
  alt resolved Single
    R->>P: existing canonical request
  else resolved Team
    R->>E: issue and consume bounded child envelopes
    E-->>C: verified task scope
    C->>L: child runs + safe lifecycle metadata
    C-->>P: untrusted findings
  end
  P-->>U: final answer + inspectable metadata
```

The hybrid pilot is sequential in phase one. Parallel fan-out, aggregate parent-wide monetary reservation, and live-provider quality comparison remain explicit follow-up work. The Agents view reconstructs routing and child summaries from durable Run Ledger data after reload.

The connection to the course spine is explicit: **Policy → Run → Approval → Tool → Evidence → Evaluation**. Inputs are authenticated/scoped data; outputs are typed results plus inspectable evidence; mutable authority never comes from model prose.

## Architecture and components

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  P[Grounded parent run] --> R[ChildVerificationRequest]
  R --> V[EvidenceVerifierSpecialist: no tools]
  V --> X[Strict verdict validation]
  X --> L[(child Run Ledger events)]
  L --> P
  P --> O[filtered answer + child summary]
```

### Component responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility | Must not be assumed |
|---|---|---|
| Grounded workflow | Select claims/evidence and consume verdicts conservatively. | A child verdict replaces deterministic grounding. |
| Verifier specialist | Call one model with no tools and enforce budgets/schema. | The model judgment is deterministic. |
| Run repository | Create scoped child lineage and ordered lifecycle events. | Lineage proves benefit or causality. |
| Measurement fixture | Compare a versioned baseline and child result. | Fixture performance generalizes to production. |

## Startup sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Config
  participant App
  participant Provider
  participant Runs
  Config->>App: verifier_enabled and bounded settings
  App->>Provider: construct shared typed provider + breaker
  App->>Runs: initialize repository
  App->>App: inject EvidenceVerifierSpecialist or None
  Note over App: no dynamic specialist registry
```

Verifier startup validates finite settings, reuses the app-scoped circuit-broken provider and run repository, and injects either one `EvidenceVerifierSpecialist` or `None`. Disabled mode remains explicit.

## Per-request sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant W as Grounded workflow
  participant V as Verifier child
  participant P as Provider
  participant L as Run Ledger
  W->>V: fixed claims, evidence, budget, parent_run_id
  V->>L: ensure_child_run + started event
  V->>P: JSON request, tools=empty
  alt valid bounded verdicts
    P-->>V: strict JSON
    V->>L: completed + usage/latency
    V-->>W: verdicts
  else malformed/timeout/budget/provider failure
    V->>L: failed or exhausted, safe reason
    V-->>W: conservative result/escalation
  end
```

The alternate path is part of the design: denial, stale state, malformed input, timeout, cancellation, or dependency error produces a stable bounded result/evidence rather than invented success.

## Class and dependency view

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class GroundedDocumentWorkflow
  class EvidenceVerifierSpecialist
  class ModelProvider
  class RunRepository
  class ChildVerificationRequest
  GroundedDocumentWorkflow --> EvidenceVerifierSpecialist
  EvidenceVerifierSpecialist --> ChildVerificationRequest
  EvidenceVerifierSpecialist --> ModelProvider
  EvidenceVerifierSpecialist --> RunRepository
```

The implementation favors dependency injection and composition. The arrows show use, not inheritance.

## State and lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Created
  Created --> Running: child event started
  Running --> Completed: valid verdict set
  Running --> Failed: malformed/provider error
  Running --> TimedOut: deadline
  Running --> Exhausted: token budget
  Completed --> [*]
  Failed --> [*]
  TimedOut --> [*]
  Exhausted --> [*]
```

Only source-defined statuses/events are evidence. A transient UI state must not overwrite a durable terminal state.

## Try it: bounded exercise

### Goal

Run the focused contract set and turn each passing test into one precise claim plus one limitation.

### Safety and setup

- Working directory starts at repository root; backend dependencies must be installed with `uv`.
- The focused set uses fixtures/local state. Do not insert real credentials or point fixtures at external services.
- Side effects are test databases/processes cleaned by fixtures; if interrupted, remove only resources you created.

### Steps

```bash
cd backend
uv run pytest -q tests/unit/test_delegation_contract.py tests/unit/test_evidence_verifier.py tests/integration/test_verifier_benefit.py
```

Create a two-column note: **proved invariant** and **not proved**. Include at least one security invariant, one failure path, and one evidence path.

### Done criteria

- [ ] Every focused test passes, or a real environment blocker is recorded without fabricating output.
- [ ] At least three results are tied to exact symbols and assertions.
- [ ] The learner states the local/provider/deployment boundary aloud.
- [ ] Temporary resources are absent or explicitly cleaned.

## Security and failure modes

| Threat or failure | Boundary/control | Failure behavior | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invented evidence ID | Subset validation | Malformed response fails; no verdict accepted | Model can still misjudge supplied evidence. |
| Tool/recursive authority | Request requires empty tools; one wired specialist | Construction rejects tools | Prompt isolation is not a process sandbox. |
| Timeout/provider failure | Finite timeout and at most one configured retry | Terminal child evidence and conservative parent handling | External provider behavior was not finally verified. |
| Cross-owner lineage | Parent/child carry user and project | Scoped ledger reads/writes | Database privileges still matter. |

Also review concurrent child creation, terminal-event races, claim-text redaction, and false-rejection cost whenever this path changes.

## Observability and evidence path

```text
correlation ID → authenticated owner/project → typed runtime event → redacted log + durable Run Ledger → metric/OTLP span/UI → evaluation
```

| Evidence | Link or command | Claim supported | Scope/limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Canonical status | [Implementation evidence](../../../IMPLEMENTATION-EVIDENCE.md) | Separates exists/wired/tested/observed/UI/deployed. | Mutable evidence; inspect revision. |
| Architecture | [Architecture diagrams](../../../ARCHITECTURE-DIAGRAMS.md) | Wider component and trust boundaries. | Diagram is not runtime observation. |
| Focused tests | command above | Deterministic contracts and failure paths. | Fixture/local scope. |

Never expose credentials, raw provider exceptions, tool payloads, personal data, or hidden chain-of-thought as “evidence.”

## Lab vs production

| Dimension | Demonstrated in repository/lab | Required or unverified for production |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment | Local/test paths and artifacts. | Public ingress, multi-host operation, SLO/on-call; public deployment is deferred. |
| Data and scale | Bounded fixtures and local persistent data. | Capacity, retention, sustained load and multi-replica behavior. |
| Providers | Deterministic/mock/local dependencies as explicitly linked. | Final external providers were not verified. |
| Security/operations | Tested ownership, validation, policy and redaction controls. | Independent audit, rotation, production alerting and incident drills. |

Contract, integration, benchmark fixture, and local UI evidence establish one child. The final external providers were not verified. There is no dynamic swarm, recursive planner, generic reflection loop, or proof that the reviewer is always correct. Multi-node agent networking is intentionally deferred; see its [architecture and evidence threshold](../../../REMAINING-DEFERRED-GAPS.md#1-distributed-multi-node-agent-network).

## Interview answer

### 30-second answer

> Cogentrex uses one bounded verifier child only after grounded claim construction. It receives exact claims and evidence, no tools, and finite token/time/retry budgets. Strict parsing rejects unknown claims and evidence; child events persist under parent_run_id. Tests and a deterministic benefit fixture prove the control path, not model truth. External providers and swarms are not claimed.

### Deeper follow-ups

- **Why no tools?** Evidence review needs no new facts or side effects; tools would expand authority.
- **What is deterministic?** Request/result validation, budget enforcement and fail-closed handling—not model judgment.
- **How is benefit shown?** A versioned fixture compares outcomes and lineage without claiming universal quality.
- **What remains?** External-provider acceptance, representative quality sets, cost/latency objectives and multi-instance tests.

## Self-check

1. Why is this safer than giving a reviewer tools?
2. What prevents citation invention?
3. Where is lineage persisted?
4. Is retry always safe?
5. What does the benefit fixture prove?
6. Why is this not reflection or a swarm?

<details>
<summary>Answer guide</summary>

1. The child cannot expand context or create side effects; its authority is the sealed evidence packet.
2. Request/output validators require every verdict evidence ID to be a subset of IDs delegated for that claim.
3. RunRepository.ensure_child_run creates the child with parent_run_id and the same owner/project scope.
4. Only explicitly classified transient provider failure gets the tiny configured retry budget; malformed output is not made trustworthy by retries.
5. Deterministic control/measurement behavior and trade-offs, not external model quality or source truth.
6. It is one purpose-built post-generation evidence check; it neither generically critiques arbitrary reasoning nor dynamically creates agents.
