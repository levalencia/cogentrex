# Career preparation

> **Rule:** every claim needs a source symbol, behavior test, evidence scope, and limitation

This page helps learners practice explaining Cogentrex's architecture, trade-offs,
evidence, and limitations in technical interviews. Definitions remain canonical
in the [concept pages](../concept-map.md); exact implementation anchors live in
[code bookmarks](../reference/code-bookmarks.md).

## The answer spine

Use **problem → design → request trace → evidence → trade-off → boundary**. Say “the repository demonstrates” rather than “the system guarantees.” The verified deployment target is production-like local Docker Compose, not a public production service.

## 2-minute walkthrough

1. **Problem (15s):** Cogentrex is a local Agent Reliability Workbench for inspecting and governing agent behavior.
2. **Architecture (25s):** `create_app` constructs scoped persistence, tools, policy, approvals, resilience, and observability; `create_chat_runtime` injects them into `AgentRuntime`.
3. **Request (40s):** `AgentRuntime.run` loops over model responses and native tool calls under iteration, token, tool, and wall-clock budgets. Policy evaluates a detached exact binding; `ASK` requires a durable authorization; events record inspectable outcomes.
4. **Evidence (20s):** the Run Ledger persists ordered events; recorded-run evaluation measures fixtures; RAG returns citations and deterministic claim checks.
5. **Trade-off and boundary (20s):** explicit contracts and fail-closed controls improve auditability but add coordination and persistence complexity. Local tests and Compose evidence do not prove public deployment, scale, provider parity, or model quality.

|---:|---|---|---|
| 0–2 | Agent boundary and typed provider/tool ports | [`ModelProvider`, `ToolExecutor`](../../../backend/app/runtime/ports.py); [module 00](../modules/00-agent-anatomy/README.md) | What is deterministic versus model-driven? |

## 45-minute deep dive

Use the 15-minute route, then add these evidence stops:

1. **Startup and DI (4m):** trace [`lifespan`](../../../backend/app/main.py) and [`create_chat_runtime`](../../../backend/app/runtime/factory.py). Explain Protocol-based composition using [module 01](../modules/01-python-architecture/README.md).
2. **Provider-to-tool trust boundary (6m):** inspect snapshots in [`AgentRuntime._snapshot_provider_tool_calls`](../../../backend/app/runtime/engine.py), policy preparation, and execution in `run`. Read [`test_invalid_later_provider_call_fails_closed_before_any_call_executes`](../../../backend/tests/unit/test_runtime_policy.py).
3. **Approval lifecycle (4m):** follow [`DurableApprovalBroker.authorizer`](../../../backend/app/security/live_approvals.py) and [`ApprovalRepository`](../../../backend/app/security/approval_repository.py). Use [`test_exact_run_binding_and_concurrent_decision_has_one_winner`](../../../backend/tests/unit/test_durable_live_approvals.py).
4. **Evidence ledger (5m):** follow runtime event → [`CompositeEventSink.emit`](../../../backend/app/observability/runtime_events.py) → [`RunRepository.append`](../../../backend/app/services/run_ledger.py) → `/api/runs/{run_id}/events`. Explain sequence allocation, owner scope, redaction, replay, fork, and compare.
5. **Knowledge and evaluation (6m):** trace document ingestion, [`SqlJsonVectorStore`](../../../backend/app/services/sql_json_vector_store.py), [`GroundedDocumentWorkflow`](../../../backend/app/services/grounded_rag.py), and [`EvaluationService`](../../../backend/app/eval/service.py). Keep retrieval, groundedness, faithfulness, citation, and durable post-run evaluation distinct.
6. **Bounded verifier (4m):** show evidence-only child input, model-generated verdict, schema validation, budgets, no-tools isolation, and parent-child lineage using [module 11](../modules/11-bounded-delegation/README.md).
7. **Governed MCP (4m):** trace stdio initialization, inventory normalization, enablement, policy, exact-bound approval, invocation, and sanitized event output using [module 12](../modules/12-governed-mcp/README.md).
8. **Auth and observability (5m):** trace JWT identity and ownership into SSE, safe events, logs, metrics, traces, and Workbench inspection using [module 13](../modules/13-auth-ui-observability/README.md).
9. **Failure and recovery (4m):** contrast retry, idempotency, deadline, breaker, fallback, rate limiting, readiness, migration, backup, and restore using [modules 10](../modules/10-resilience/README.md) and [14](../modules/14-local-operations/README.md).
10. **Close honestly (3m):** use [module 15](../modules/15-capstone/README.md) and the [deferred-gap register](../../REMAINING-DEFERRED-GAPS.md) to state measured evidence and limits: local-only deployment, provider evidence boundaries, no distributed network/GPU serving/training/public anonymous sharing, and no autonomous production mutation.

## Likely follow-ups

- **Why Protocols and DI?** Replace provider, executor, sink, and authorizer without making the control loop depend on concrete adapters; tests can inject bounded doubles.
- **Is error feedback self-reflection?** No. Tool-error feedback allows another ReAct step; deterministic claim verification, one bounded verifier child, and post-run evaluation are separate mechanisms.
- **Why persist events?** To inspect ordered behavior, compare runs, and evaluate recorded inputs without relying on hidden chain-of-thought.
- **Biggest risk?** A mutable or mismatched tool identity crossing authorization. The runtime snapshots and revalidates identifiers and argument hashes, then fails closed.
- **What would production require?** Direct evidence for deployment, SLOs, capacity, backup cadence, restore drills, secret rotation, provider parity, incident response, and external traffic.
- **Why are the six gaps omissions rather than failures?** They require different trust, infrastructure, data-governance, or operating models. Deferring them keeps the demonstrated local policy/evidence boundary reproducible and prevents artifacts from being presented as runtime proof; cite the [gap register](../../REMAINING-DEFERRED-GAPS.md).

## Harness engineering questions

These questions test knowledge of the frontier harness mechanisms implemented in Phases 0–5:

- **Hooks:** "How would you let a user block specific tool calls without modifying the runtime engine?" → HookRegistry wraps EventSink; before-hooks on TOOL_CALL_REQUESTED can return BLOCK. See [hooks concept](../concepts/hooks-and-extensions.md).
- **Compaction:** "What happens when context exceeds the token budget mid-conversation?" → Multi-layer compaction: lossless prune → structured distill → lossy LLM summarize with circuit breaker. See [compaction concept](../concepts/context-compaction.md).
- **Security modes:** "How do you graduate from 'allow everything' to 'deny everything'?" → Seven PermissionMode levels; stateful evaluator auto-downgrades after repeated denials. See [security concept](../concepts/graduated-security-model.md).
- **Delegation:** "What patterns exist for multi-agent coordination?" → Coordinator (zero inheritance), Fork (full copy, single-level), Swarm (shared queue). See [delegation concept](../concepts/delegation-patterns.md).
- **Worktrees:** "How do parallel agents avoid file collisions?" → Git worktree isolation; each task gets its own branch and working directory. See [worktree concept](../concepts/worktree-isolation.md).
- **Bootstrap:** "How does the system decide which tools to load?" → Four-stage bootstrap: minimal → read-only → trust boundary → full tools. Untrusted sessions stay read-only.

## Practice contract

For each duration, record yourself, stay within ±10%, cite at least three exact symbols and two behavior tests, state one trade-off and two unverified boundaries, and correct uncertainty rather than inventing evidence. Use the [capstone rubric](../workshops/capstone-rubric.md) for scoring.
