# Learn from zero

> **Track status:** draft; validate against the current branch before teaching
> **Audience:** programmers new to agent systems
> **Time:** 32–48 focused hours for modules 00–15, plus optional labs

This is a navigation route, not a second textbook. Follow the linked module and concept pages for canonical explanations. Check unfamiliar words in the [beginner glossary](../reference/glossary.md).

## Before you start

You need basic Python, HTTP/JSON, command-line, and Git familiarity. Start by reading the [syllabus prerequisites and evidence policy](../syllabus.md). You may do every reading and paper exercise without credentials. Executable labs require the setup named by their module.

## Route

| Stage | Read | Make | You are ready to continue when… |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. What an agent is | [00 — Agent anatomy](../modules/00-agent-anatomy/README.md) | Lifecycle map | You can separate model, runtime, tools, policy, and evidence. |
| 2. How Python parts fit | [01 — Python architecture](../modules/01-python-architecture/README.md) | Dependency diagram | You can explain OOP, Protocol, DI, and async in plain English. |
| 3. How a run is represented | [02 — Typed runtime](../modules/02-typed-runtime/README.md) | Runtime trace | You can name inputs, state, output, and terminal result. |
| 4. How action stays bounded | [03 — ReAct loop](../modules/03-react-loop/README.md) | Bounded-loop trace | You can distinguish ReAct from generic self-reflection. |
| 5. How tools form contracts | [04 — Tools and schemas](../modules/04-tools-and-schemas/README.md) | Typed tool | You can trace validation before execution. |
| 6. How risky action is governed | [05 — Policy and approvals](../modules/05-policy-and-approvals/README.md) | Deny/ask/allow probe | You can explain exact binding and fail-closed behavior. |
| 7. What persists | [06 — Context and memory](../modules/06-context-and-memory/README.md) | Context-boundary note | You can separate request, conversation, and encrypted memory. |
| 8. How evidence becomes durable | [07 — Run Ledger](../modules/07-run-ledger/README.md) | Event timeline | You can explain replay/fork/compare limits. |
| 9. How answers use documents | [08 — RAG and grounding](../modules/08-rag-grounding/README.md) | Cited answer | You can separate retrieval, groundedness, faithfulness, and citation. |
| 10. How behavior is measured | [09 — Evaluation harness](../modules/09-evaluation-harness/README.md) | Recorded-run evaluation | You can state what a fixture proves and does not prove. |
| 11. How failures are bounded | [10 — Resilience](../modules/10-resilience/README.md) | Failure drill | You can choose retry, timeout, idempotency, breaker, fallback, or rate limit for a scenario. |
| 12. How bounded delegation adds a second opinion | [11 — Bounded verifier](../modules/11-bounded-delegation/README.md) | Parent-child evidence graph | You can distinguish model judgment from deterministic schema and budget controls. |
| 13. How external tools are governed | [12 — Governed MCP](../modules/12-governed-mcp/README.md) | MCP lifecycle trace | You can trace discovery, inventory, policy, approval, and invocation. |
| 14. How the system becomes inspectable | [13 — Auth, UI, SSE, and observability](../modules/13-auth-ui-observability/README.md) | Observable request | You can separate ownership, events, logs, metrics, and traces. |
| 15. How the local system is operated and recovered | [14 — Local operations](../modules/14-local-operations/README.md) | Recovery report | You can explain liveness, readiness, migration, backup, restore, RTO, and RPO. |
| 16. How to defend the capstone | [15 — Capstone](../modules/15-capstone/README.md) | 2/15/45-minute walkthrough | Every claim points to code, test, observation, and limitation. |

## Beginner checkpoints

After stages 1–4, explain one request using only boxes and arrows. After stages 5–8, add trust boundaries and durable evidence. After stages 9–11, add a measurable claim and one controlled failure. After stages 12–16, defend delegation, integration, observability, recovery, and capstone limits. If you cannot answer a module self-check without reading its answer guide, revisit its linked concept rather than memorizing this route.

## Safe lab habits

- Copy `.env.example`; never commit a real token, password, document, or memory export.
- Prefer the mock/scripted provider when the exercise permits it.
- Use disposable local data and the exact cleanup step in each module.
- Record revision, command, environment, result, and limitation.
- Do not call local Compose “production,” JSON embeddings “pgvector,” or one verifier child a “swarm.”

## Harness engineering extensions

These concepts extend the core modules with frontier harness mechanisms from Claude Code, Codex, Pi, and DeepSeek:

| Concept | After module | What you learn |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| [Hooks and extensions](../concepts/hooks-and-extensions.md) | 04 — Tools | Register custom logic on agent lifecycle events |
| [Graduated security model](../concepts/graduated-security-model.md) | 05 — Policy | Seven permission modes, denial tracking, mode transformation |
| [Context compaction](../concepts/context-compaction.md) | 06 — Memory | Multi-layer compaction pipeline, circuit breaker, /compact command |
| [Session branching](../concepts/session-branching.md) | 06 — Memory | Session tree, fork from any point, /resume |
| [Delegation patterns](../concepts/delegation-patterns.md) | 11 — Delegation | Coordinator, Fork, Swarm patterns with tool filtering |
| [Worktree isolation](../concepts/worktree-isolation.md) | 14 — Operations | Git worktree per task, environment deltas, SYSTEM.md |

- Learn with a cohort: [Company workshops](company-workshops.md).
- Operate the local target: [Operations and reliability](operations-and-reliability.md).
- Find implementation detail: [Code bookmarks](../reference/code-bookmarks.md), [API map](../reference/api-map.md), and [test map](../reference/test-map.md).
